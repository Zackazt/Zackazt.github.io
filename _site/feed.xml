It is used specifically to hold data for applications that are currently running, including your operating system. So when you load up your favorite app, the Operating System loads the application from the hard drive into RAM. Unlike RAM’s cousin SAM (sequential access memory), applications can access the data in RAM by address, allowing for much faster speeds than going through each byte sequentially until it gets to its destination. RAM is most commonly seen as small...</description>

Motherboards are also often referred to as logic boards or mainboards. The job of the motherboard is to literally connect all of the computer’s components, and to be the physical medium for the electricity and data that gets distributed to all of the components. Modern motherboards allow computer components to be plugged in and removed easily so that it’s simple to customize, upgrade, or replace parts....</description>

        <title>Why Regulations On Artificial Intelligence Should Be Discussed Today</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Though it may often be thought of as science-fiction, a future with super-intelligent machines seems certain and could pose a serious threat to our species. Artificial intelligence is everywhere today. It’s in phones, watches, and even in our cars. Artificial Intelligence is software that has been programmed to analyze and act without direct instructions. A.I. is very powerful, because if a human brain could be emulated, it would be able to solve human problems at a very fast rate. The fast rate comes from engineering faster processing speeds over time. Moore’s Law was an observation by Gordon Moore in 1965...</description>

        <title>A Letter To The FCC Chairman</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Ajit Pai,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You state that you are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/fcc-chair-ajit-pai-explains-wants-scrap-net-neutrality&quot;&gt;“in favor of a free and open Internet”&lt;/a&gt; for American citizens, however, your recent announcement on voting to repeal the FCC’s Open Internet Order directly contradicts any such statement of supporting a free and open Internet. Protecting Internet neutrality is absolutely vital for the American Internet to continue to grow organically. You state that the Title II regulations do more harm than good for the American people in regards to Internet access, and that without these regulations, the evolution of the Internet would then be in the hands of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/22/ajit-pai-fcc-defends-net-neutrality-repeal-25816&quot;&gt;“engineers...</description>

        <title>An Analysis of Net Neutrality in America</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; at the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net Neutrality is a term that most people today have heard, but how much do you know about it? Should you care? Afterall, it’s not that big of a deal, right? It’s just the internet. As long as you can check your social media accounts and watch your online movies, do you think you’d be satisfied regardless?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;net-neutrality-is-not-necessarily-about-the-present&quot;&gt;Net neutrality is not necessarily about the present.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing to keep in mind here is that companies want to discriminate against certain forms of internet traffic in order to suit their business desires. The goal of net...</description>

The very first job I had was cleaning at a seafood restaurant when I was in High School. My second job was as a cook at Steak n Shake, a popular burger joint.
