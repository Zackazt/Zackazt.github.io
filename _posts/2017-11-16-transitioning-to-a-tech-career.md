## TL;DR
Start with basic tech certifications such as the A+, find an area you are interested in, and then pursue it through self-study and certifications.

## My Story
---
I started off my career working at restaraunts. The very first job I had was cleaning at a seafood restaraunt when I was in High School. My second job was a cook at Steak n Shake. I hopped around from restaraunt to restaraunt as I was traveling. I was not sure what I wanted out of life at this point. One thing I was certain of, was that, **I hated working**. It wasn't necessarily that I was lazy, but I constantly felt that my time could be put to better use than getting yelled at by a stressed out manager while grease was popping in my face, just to make enough money to barely make it by.

On my 23rd bithday I was given a 7x7 Rubik's Cube puzzle. I had always been into Rubik's Cubes and had practiced solving them as fast as I could, but this 7x7 was a huge step up from the 3x3 standard cube. I grabbed it and instantly began solving it and looking up tutorials. I worked at it, non-stop, for somehwere around 5 hours without any breaks. **I was obsessed with it**. After completing it I looked at the time and realized how much time had gone by without me feeling even slightly bored or uncomfortable. It made me realize that I wished work was like that. 

### **So why wasn't it?**

The lesson I learned from this 7x7 puzzle was that I enjoy thinking and solving problems. If I could find a job where I think and solve problems, then work would fly by and I would enjoy myself. I contemplated for some time and decided to look into programming. rogramming was a perfect fit for this passion I had found within myself. I began teaching myself how to program, and even though it was very difficult at first, I became decent enough to begin thinking about a career in it. 

At the time of these realizations I was unemployed. I knew that I needed an immediate fix to this, so my next job would definitely not be programming, however, I still knew I needed to get a job that was somewhat relevant to my goals. I ended up applying to Best Buy for a Geek Squad agent. I was hired and was working as a repair consultant until eventually becoming a repair technician. Now that I was immersed in the field of technology at work, I was able to spend less time getting yelled at, and more time focusing on technology and my career. I spent a lot of time studying for a tech certification known as the A+ certification offered by CompTIA. The A+ certification is considered the standard entry-level certification for PC technicians. As I studied for this, I was able to put what I was learning to practice at work. It was a perfect fit. This was not a programming job, however, it allowed me to spend more time focusing on learning more about technology and getting more relevant work experience. While I worked here and studied, I also worked on coding projects. I developed an app for Android to help people study for the A+ exam. In doing so, this also helped me a lot with memorizing the terms for the exam. I ended up building a few apps and websites, and began applying for programming jobs. Within two months I was hired as a software engineer. 

**The point of this story** is that surrounding yourself with situations that have some relevancy to your career goals is vital for success. I surrounded myself with technology to learn more about it. I wrote an app that was releavant to a tech exam that I was studying for. These tricks were the most important thing for my success.

## **So what's the plan?**

My reccommendation to those who are trying to transition into a tech career is to start with the A+ certification. This is a very great resource to learn a very wide range of things about technology and how it works on a lower level. The certification itself is also great to have on a resume'. Once you've completed this, you will have a better idea of what areas of technology interest you more. Do you like networking? Security? Engineering? Once you figure this out, pursue another certification that more closely fits your interest. For instance, if you become interested in cryptography, study for the Security+ exam. If you become interested in how the internet works, study for the Network+ exam. Whether or not you pursuea career in the area you though you would originally, you will learn a lot about yourself and your career interests.
