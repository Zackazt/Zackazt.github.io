### Will there be other tutorial series'?

Yes! I will be creating an intermediate, and an advanced JavaScript/Web Development series as well. On top of these I also will be creating "applied" programming tutorials. I tend to do thesse live on Twitch and then export them to YouTube afterwards. So if you like that sort of thing, follow me on Twitch and YouTube! Also feel free to network with me on Twitter, and Instagram. All of these links are available at the top of my website.

### This series doesn't seem complete?

There is a chance that you've stumbled upon my tutorial series while I am still creating it. I am recording the series in chunks and uploading as I go. Be sure to subscribe to not miss out on the remainder of the series or future series'!
