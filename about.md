## About

I am an former PC Technician who now develops apps and websites, animates educational content and music videos, designs logos, etc. I had the idea to start reaching out to educate the public on beginner to advanced topics in technology. My goal is to make it easy and fun to learn these topics, and to get people interested in technology. Feel free to contact me! Follow me on social media to stay up to date!
